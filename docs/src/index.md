# ProxAL

[ProxAL.jl](https://github.com/exanauts/ProxAL.jl) is a Julia package to solve linearly coupled block-structured nonlinear programming problems. In its current version, `ProxAL` can only solve multi-period contingency-constrained AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problems. Its main feature is a distributed parallel implementation, which allows running on high-performance computing architectures. 

This document describes the algorithm, API and main functions of `ProxAL.jl`.
